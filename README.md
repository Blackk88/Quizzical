A simple quiz app built in React using trivia API. 
You can choose categories and and difficulty as well as number of questions. 

While working on this app I learnt about: 

- React props, state
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- how to managed API request in React (side effects)
- how to use separate components, and how to manage them (lift up state to better control for the app)
- JS methods for working with different data (arrays, objecst, etc.)
